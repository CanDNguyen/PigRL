# PigRL
Malmo platform, is to train an agent to be proficient with Minecraftâ€™s bow and arrow. The basic setup/ input will be to place the agent in a level environment with a bow and several arrows in their inventory, and the only other actor being a moving pig. The agent will be trained to kill the pig with the bow and arrow, which is to say that action will serve as the output.
